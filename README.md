## Analyze A/B Text Results

### Project Description

Course: “Practical Statistics” offered by Udacity as part of their Data Analyst Nanodegree Program.

Data: Almost 300,000 rows of website user data detailing whether a user received a new or old (“treatment vs control”) version of a website landing page and whether they “converted” (i.e., bought the company’s product) or not.

Project Tasks:

- Clean the data of mismatches and duplicates.
- Perform the statistical analysis for the A/B test using three different approaches: bootstrapping simulation, a built-in function, and logistic regression.
- Interpret and report the conclusions.
